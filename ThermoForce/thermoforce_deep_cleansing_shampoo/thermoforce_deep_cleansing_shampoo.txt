Description:

ThermoForce Deep Cleansing Shampoo detoxifies and deeply removes buildup and surface impurities from hair and helps to penetrate into the cuticle of the hair, preparing all types of hair texture. Developed with Panthenol, it restructures the dry and porous hair.


Directions for Use:

Dampen your hair with, preferably, lukewarm water. 
Work a liberal amount of pre-treatment shampoo in your hands and then apply to the damp hair, massaging the product until you have a good lather. Massaging makes it easier for the product to get all the grease out.
Depending on the amount of buildup and oils on the hair, the shampoo may not lather very much, but that doesn't mean it's not working. Rinse very well. 
Apply again, and this time it should get sudsy. Let the shampoo sit on the head for about 3-5 minutes. Letting the shampoo sit helps break down and release the product buildup, which is crucial. 
Then, rinse well again, dry, and follow up with a really good treatment or, a hair mask to restore all of that lost moisture.
