Directions for Use:

Wash hair with ThermoForce Deep Cleansing shampoo, rinse the hair out of the shampoo completely. Blow dry it 90% - 100%. Divide the hair into sections. Wear gloves and start applying ThermoForce Protein Express Treatment on each section, spreading across the length, an inch away from the root to the end of the hair. Comb the hair to evenly spread the treatment and to remove the excess cream. Leave the product on for 30 - 50 minutes, depending on the health and resilience of the hair. Gently, rinse the extra product out of the hair with water and towel dry it by simply pressing it on the hair. Cold dry the hair 100%. Take smaller sections of the hair and use flat iron with a temperature of 210°C - 230°C. Starting at the nape, move the iron slowly from the scalp to the ends of hair. After the ironing process, cool the hair with hair dryer. Apply ThermoForce Mask on wet hair. Let it act for 5 to 10 minutes and rinse.
