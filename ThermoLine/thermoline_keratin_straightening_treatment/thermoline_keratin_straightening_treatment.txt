Directions for Use:

After washing hair with ThermoLine Deep Cleansing Shampoo, blow dry it 90% - 100%. Divide the hair into sections. Wear gloves and start applying ThermoLine Keratin Straightening Treatment on each section, spreading across the length, an inch away from the root to the end of the hair. Comb the hair to evenly spread the treatment and to remove the excess cream. Leave the product on for 20 - 25 minutes. Do not rinse it off. Cold dry the hair 100%. Take smaller sections of the hair and use flat iron with a temperature of 190°C - 220°C. Starting at the nape, move the iron slowly from the scalp to the ends of hair. After the ironing process, cool the hair with hair dryer and wash off the product using just the water. Apply ThermoLine Mask. Let it act for 5 to 10 minutes and rinse.
