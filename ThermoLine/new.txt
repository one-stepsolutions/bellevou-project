A keratin treatments smooths hair, making it more shiny and manageable. It's not a hair straightening treatment, but rather one that eliminates frizz and adds gloss when its protein coats the outside layer, known as the cuticle.

A La Braziliana brand treatment begins with chelating products, which strip excess minerals and impurities so the protein can stick more effectively. Then, the keratin treatment is applied. Then, instead of being rinsed out, it's heated and dried onto the hair. When protected by the correct products, such as gentle, sulfate-free shampoos, the glossy results last two to four months.
