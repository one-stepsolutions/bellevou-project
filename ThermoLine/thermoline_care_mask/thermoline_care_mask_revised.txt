Description:

ThermoLine Care Mask has been developed with Amisol TRIO™ Concentrate Bio Nutrient which is composed of essential bio-lipids and hydro-protective agents. This bio-lipid complex adheres to hair surface and forms a protective film around the hair that protects them against dryness, as
well as reduces frizz and breakage, restoring the elasticity, softness and the natural shine of the hair lost due to harsh environmental conditions and chemical processes.


Directions for Use:

Apply a small amount on clean and moist hair, massaging gently over the entire hair. Let it sit for 5 to 10 minutes. Rinse out the extra care product using lukewarm water until the hair is squeaky clean. Finish as you desire.
