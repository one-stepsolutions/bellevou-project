Directions for Use:

Wash hair with shampoo from Bellevou Home Care range. Rinse the hair out of the shampoo completely and remove the excess moisture by pressing the towel on the hair. Dry the hair up to 70% by using hair dryer. Divide the hair into smaller sections. Wear gloves and start applying NovaLair Hear Treatment with Baobab on each section, spreading across the length, an inch away from the root to the end of the hair. Comb the hair to evenly spread the treatment and to remove the excess cream. Leave the product on for 30 - 40 minutes. Rinse under running water to let go the extra product on the hair. Towel dry to remove the extra moisture by pressing it on the hair. Using hair dryer, dry the hair just enough to feel damp. Taking small sections, use flat iron with a temperature of around 220°C. Starting at the nape, work the iron slowly from the scalp to the ends of hair 7 - 10 times. Perform the desired procedure and finish it. It is recommended to undergo this process 3-4 times with 4-6 weeks gap between the successive procedure.
