Directions for Use:

Wash hair with shampoo from Bellevou Home Care range. Rinse the hair out of the shampoo completely and remove the excess moisture by pressing the towel on the hair. Dry the hair up to 70% by using hair dryer. Divide the hair into fairly large sections. Wear gloves and start applying ResQ Express Hair Repair Treatment on each section, spreading across the length, an inch away from the root to the end of the hair. Comb the hair to evenly spread the treatment and to remove the excess cream. Leave the product on for 5 - 10 minutes. Divide the hair again into convenient number of sections and use flat iron with a temperature of around 170°C. Starting at the nape, move the iron slowly from the scalp to the ends of hair 5 - 7 times. Rinse under running water after letting the hair cool for about 10 minutes. Towel dry the extra moisture by pressing it on the hair. Perform the desired procedure and finish it. It is recommended to undergo this process 3-4 times with 2-5 weeks gap between the successive procedure for optimum health of the hair.
